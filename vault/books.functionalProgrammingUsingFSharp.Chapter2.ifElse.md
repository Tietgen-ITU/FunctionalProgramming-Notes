The expression form for if else is the following 
```F#
if exp1 then exp2 else exp3
```
Here the `exp1` is an expression that reuterns the type of `bool` where as the other expressions are performing something.

A concrete example is the following:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-05-12-37-07.png)

It is also possible to replace the pattern matching with the following syntax in the function:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-05-12-38-17.png)
