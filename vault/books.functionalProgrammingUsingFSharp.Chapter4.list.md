When we want to declare a list then we can do the following:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-07-19-18-19.png)

However sometimes we want a more complex list with a more complex type:

![](/assets/images/2022-02-07-19-19-01.png)

We can also declare list with functions in it:

![](/assets/images/2022-02-07-19-19-28.png)
