It is possible to declare our own types.
We do so like in the following example:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-09-08-39-13.png)

Sometimes F# does not know that it should use your type like the following example:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-09-08-43-03.png)

But the two types we have defined use the `float * float * float` so the type can be used in the function any way.
