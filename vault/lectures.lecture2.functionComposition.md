Functions can be composed.
In Mathematics we write:

Here we have an example:
                   
![](/assets/images/2022-02-09-08-28-50.png)
>**Note:** Here we solve the first function $y*y$ in order to calculate the $x$ value and then give the value to the infix operator `+` and solve the other function. We parse the method in function composition by using the `>>` or `<<`

The thing about this is that the function on the left of `>>` get evaluated first then it parses the value to the next function and evalutes its function with that value.
