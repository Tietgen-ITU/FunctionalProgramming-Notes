Functions can be composed.
In Mathematics we write:

Here we have an example:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-09-08-28-50.png)
>**Note:** Here we solve the first function $y*y$ in order to calculate the $x$ value and then give the value to the infix operator `+` and solve the other function. We parse the method in function composition by using the `>>` or `<<`

// Todo the rest of this does not belong to function composition

Some things in imperative languages is not valid:

However the above example is acutally valid for functional languages!

## What is an expression?

An expression is a computation that returns something that is calculated or evaluated e.g.
