Partial application is when you can reuse the function and apply it in different applications.
See the example below:

This is the example from the book:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-09-08-19-05.png)

The result:
![](/assets/images/2022-02-09-08-20-55.png)

This is really useful in order to make functions reuseable.
