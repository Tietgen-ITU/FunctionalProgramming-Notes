You can do nested let in functions. 
This is useful when you want to reuse some values or calculations.

This function misses some let functions.

We can make it better by adding `let`:

This can also make us create local functions:

>**Note:** that the indentation matters. The indentation determines whether the code belongs to function x or the inner function y
